# 🤖 AI Chatbot Project

Welcome to our AI Chatbot Project! This project aims to develop a chatbot that addresses real-world challenges in South Africa using conversational AI. The chatbot will provide support in a selected sector (e.g., education, finance, or the environment), and is designed, built, and documented entirely by students.

## 📌 Project Overview

> “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” — African Proverb

This project explores the transformative potential of chatbots in addressing social and economic challenges through responsible innovation, research, and teamwork. Over a 2-month period, we will move from research to deployment — documenting everything on Notion and GitHub.
